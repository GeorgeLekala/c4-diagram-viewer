# Banking System Code Diagram

This diagram shows the detailed code structure of the Banking System:

- **Controllers Layer**: REST endpoints for account and transaction operations
- **Services Layer**: Business logic implementation with interfaces and implementations
- **Repositories Layer**: Data access interfaces for persistence
- **Models Layer**: Domain entities and types

The diagram illustrates the clean architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns and dependencies flowing inward.
